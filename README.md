# Emotion Detection App

## Overview
The Emotion Detection App is a web application developed using Streamlit that leverages computer vision and deep learning techniques to detect emotions from images. Users can upload an image or capture one using their webcam, and the app predicts the emotion expressed in the image.

## Features
- Upload images in JPG, JPEG, or PNG format (up to 200MB).
- Capture images directly from your webcam.
- Real-time emotion detection using a pre-trained deep learning model.
- User-friendly interface developed with Streamlit.
